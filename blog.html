          <b>Stress Buster</b><br><br>

          ‚ÄúLife is not easy‚Äù said an engineering student like me.<br><br>

          I‚Äôve written many essays, speeches on topics like this, but I don‚Äôt know why it takes a week for me to note down same ideas for the internet.<br><br>

          Enough with my problems, this is Pranav Jain starting with my third article.<br><br>

          As I said above Life is not easy which is true and false (Don‚Äôt confuse yourselves I‚Äôll try hard to justify myself). First why is it not easy? Maybe because of work or things which we are not able to do or fear of something or pressure of competition, etc. Whatever the reason be we always let down ourselves and try to run away from the situation. But we never try to see the situation in a different way. A way which can bring us out of that situation safely. We try to see and judge situations in our own way. That‚Äôs the starting of a problem.<br><br>

          So now the question is what to do then? First try to see things positively. For example, I get a lot of assignments and homework from college. Let‚Äôs apply my first trick according to the trick think positively. The only positive I see here is learning. This can be only done if I do my work on time. I‚Äôm 95% sure you‚Äôll get bored at the first time, at second time maybe you wont even follow my advice. But seriously doing this lets you think out of the box as you are trying to make our own creation (not applies to math problems). Now you will say that we don‚Äôt have time to do that. Yes you are right. For that you need to be more productive at your work. The reason for less productivity is stress, worry and bad mood according to me.<br><br>

          You‚Äôll find thousand of articles on how to deal with above problems and you are welcome to see and follow them.<br><br>

          But as you have read this much then c‚Äômon finish till the end (Seriously am I that boring? üòâ )  I have few ways to share with you and they mostly work for me.<br><br>

              1. Listen to any music of any genre you like. Music helps really a lot but I disagree with people saying listen to a particular type of music on that particular situation. I don‚Äôt think that will help you. The important thing here is listen to what you like in this way you‚Äôre doing what to want to do, you are your own boss. Like nowadays I like to hear electronic music everytime, anywhere.<br>
              2. Go to a gym and throw all the day‚Äôs frustration on the machines. They make you fit and stress free. If you‚Äôre not able to go to gym then do exercises at your home.<br>
              3. Sometimes it‚Äôs okay to delay. I mean enjoy your life, Work is not always everything. Break is also necessary.<br>
              4. Try to spare some time on your hobbies. If you like playing, then go play, if you like programming like me then go for it, if you reading then read, etc.<br>
              5. Go to parties, gathering events with friends especially as their level of thinking is very similar to ours.<br>
              6. Have fun at 9gag or similar sites.<br>
              7. If you don‚Äôt like to do things mentioned above then simply just start dreaming. Try to imagine a world like you want.<br>

          I would to end my article by just saying do whatever you want (keeping in mind that your actions don‚Äôt become a problem for your elders and other inhabitants of planet Earth).<br><br>

          I hope you enjoyed reading my article as much as I lost my hair writing it. (just kidding)<br><br>

        <!-- <p class="blogDate">10th Jan 2016</p> -->
        <p class="blogText2">I know I‚Äôm late to give a review to this phone. There are hundreds of articles on this phone. But this is my honest review about this phone. I‚Äôve used this phone for over a year........</p>

        <p class="fullBlogText2">
        I know I‚Äôm late to give a review to this phone. There are hundreds of articles on this phone. But this is my honest review about this phone. I‚Äôve used this phone for over a year now. So you wont go wrong anywhere reading this review if you‚Äôre still interested in buying this phone.<br><br>

        Let‚Äôs Start!<br><br>

        Sony Xperia Z1 is the successor to Xperia Z .It is one of the most talked about phones of past to past year ie 2013. This phone has one of the best design a phone could get, I can assure you that üòâ It has the one and half year old snapdragon 800 (latest one being the snapdragon 810). It is still very powerful for all your daily purposes, The phone has a very high end camera hardware which is arguably better than most today‚Äôs flagship phones (in terms of specs only) . Oh and it is water and dust resistant too!<br><br>

        Now the question arises if it has so many pros then why it is not the best phone? Answer is simple because it has some cons also. We‚Äôll see about them in few minutes.<br><br>

        <b>DESIGN</b><br><br>

        The phone is flat on both sides. It is made up of aluminium and glass. The build quality is excellent and phone looks gorgeous. Its available in three colours Black, Purple, White. I prefer the black, its my choice. The screen merges with front body very comfortably. You‚Äôll love this a lot. Infact you may even get fooled to know which is front or back side. This phone feels nice in the hands . But its just too large for a 5 inch display phone. And since it has no curvy body it‚Äôs a bit hard to hold the phone with one hand. Thanks to its slippery glass construction you have a chance of dropping it to the ground. And you really wont like to have a dent or scratch on your nice looking phone. However I was really lucky to not get a scratch, There are some minor scratches but they are on the screen guard so no worries.<br><br>

        So I really like its design , it is definitely one of my favourite design (first one being htc one m7)<br><br>

        <b>DISPLAY</b><br><br>

        It has a 5 inch full hd triluminous display. With 441 PPI, the sharpness and clarity is there for sure. It is an improvement to Xperia Z‚Äôs screen. But the viewing angles are not great. The colours tend to wash out if you tilt the phone and try to view the screen. So this is one of the major con I think, and some may even skip this phone for above said reason.  The response is great and colours are rich but white is slighty off white, if you frequently change phones you may notice it, if not then your eyes will adjust to this white.<br><br>

        In short, The display is nice but it has few cons.<br><br>

        <b>POWER</b><br><br>

        The phone is powered by snapdragon 800 clocked at 2.23 GHz backed up by 2 gigs of RAM. The 800 is still very powerful and the Adreno 330 GPU is also very high end. It can run all the games out there (NOW) at high graphic settings. I didn‚Äôt get any lags with UI till now which is great. Apps pop up very fast. However some notorious app may slow down the phone and give you occasional lag (which happens with most phones out there). There were no force shut down for me as once in two weeks I reboot my phone (You should also reboot your phone from time to time).<br><br>

        Yeah so there‚Äôs no wrong with the power. You‚Äôll enjoy using the phone (Sweet)<br><br>

        <b>CAMERA</b><br><br>

        The phone has very high end camera hardware. It combines a large 1/2.3‚Äù 20.7 MP Exmor RS‚Ñ¢ for mobile image sensor, Sony‚Äôs award-winning G Lens and intelligent BIONZ‚Ñ¢ for mobile image processing engine. All these specs make it a sweet deal for high end photography in a smartphone.<br><br>

        <b>INDOOR</b><br><br>

        Earlier when I bought the phone, I thought my phone has a problem with indoor shooting. There was so much of noise in the photos. I really didn‚Äôt like shooting indoor photos with my phone. But after many software updates the quality has improved a lot. Its not the best but still pretty decent. The videos also had a similar problem but it is solved now and its good.<br><br>

        I would say that its indoor photography is above average (very good) but certainly not the best and you wouldn‚Äôt expect this from a phone with such high end camera hardware.<br><br>

        <b>OUTDOOR</b><br><br>

        This is where the Phone shines a lot, One of the main reason why I still like this phone. The photography is just stunning, clear, beautiful, colours are accurate. The video quality is also great. You‚Äôll love the camera. No more explanation required.<br><br>

        Outdoor photography is better than most flagship phones.<br><br>

        <b>BATTERY & UI</b><br><br>

        Z1 has a big 3000 mah battery. But I‚Äôve found that the battery performance is just above average. Its not so good not so bad. I was able to use my upto 12 hours on a single charge.<br><br>

        Sony‚Äôs UI is elegant and stylish with all necessary functions but some unwanted built in apps really annoy me a lot. Im a fan of Sony‚Äôs Album and Walkman app. They are simply fantastic! The Camera app has all basic and pro functions which you will like it. And when you change the theme the whole accent colour of UI changes which looks really good.<br><br>

        <b>CONCLUSION</b><br><br>

        Finally!<br><br>

        So if you‚Äôre looking for a powerful, stylish phone than this phone will suit you. This phone has everything to give you. Except the screen and inferior speaker performance it‚Äôs a great phone.<br><br>

        <p class="blogText1">You have to be the lucky one to get your hands on this phone. Hey this is my Second Review. It‚Äôs about current Daily Driver. OnePlus created (and is creating) a lot of noise.......</p>

          YOU HAVE TO BE THE LUCKY <b>ONE</b> TO GET YOUR HANDS ON THIS PHONE<br><br>

          Hey this is my Second Review. It‚Äôs about my current Daily Driver. OnePlus created (and is creating) a lot of noise because of their phone ‚ÄòONE‚Äô. This price of this phone is very reasonable. That‚Äôs one of the most important reason of me buying this phone. It packs an awesome package of hardware, great for daily life. There are many reasons to love this phone and few to skip this phone.<br><br>

          Let‚Äôs find out!<br><br>

          <b>DESIGN</b><br><br>

          The phone has a curved and soft back (good for grip). It is nicely built and feels good in the hand. The curved back really helps a lot to hold the phone comfortably in portrait mode. I prefer that you must buy a flip (original) cover from OnePlus as the screen is sticking out from the main body of phone. Or else buy a tempered glass screen. On the RHS there‚Äôs only a Power button at a not so above position. On the LHS there‚Äôs Volume buttons and a Micro Sim tray. The buttons are tight and quite strong. On the Bottom there‚Äôs the charging and USB port along with the speakers. Above there‚Äôs the standard 3.5 mm Earphone jack. In all there are 3 microphones. It has a beautiful 5.5 inch Full HD screen. It has micro sd card slot. Be happy with 16 (white) or 64 (black) GB variant.<br><br>

          It‚Äôs a nice and thoughtfully designed phone. Its not the best design out there but definitely (looking at the price) a good design.<br><br>

          <b>DISPLAY</b><br><br>

          One has a 5.5 inch gorgeous Full HD screen. With 401 PPI you should not have a problem with a sharpness. Colours are good, rich and vibrant, Infact the white colour on this screen is the most accurate white I‚Äôve ever found on a phone. The Viewing angles are pretty good. The screen works well under direct sunlight. Earlier there was a problem with the screen, Users complained about a yellowish tint on their screen. But now the problem is now solved. My phone‚Äôs display is totally fine , no issues.<br><br>

          So I didn‚Äôt find any problem in the display. Thumbs Up from me on the Display!<br><br>

          <b>POWER</b><br><br>

          The phone has a snapdragon 801 clocked at 2.5 Ghz Quad Core backed up by 3 GB RAM (Woah). These specs are cool. But when you look at the price, Same specs become much more delightful. Throw any game at it , it will handle it beautifully. The Adreno 330 is also a very powerful GPU giving you highest graphical setting possible in a game. Due to the hardware and similar to Stock UI . Everything flies in this phone be it Web  Browsing, Media, Loading Apps, Camera, etc. It crushes Benchmarks scores.<br><br>

          In short You get more for what you pay here!<br><br>

          <b>CAMERA</b><br><br>

          The phone has a 13 mega-pixel Sony Exmor Rear Camera and 5 mega-pixel Front Camera. They also sound pretty good. It has a dual LED flash. All of this is supported by a Smart Camera Software from Cyanogen. The Camera UI is pretty simple and gets the work done. As far as I know, the picture quality depends on Three things :<br><br>

              How you hold the phone and use the Camera setting effectively<br>
              Hardware of Phone<br>
              Outside Condition<br>

          The same holds true here. Some pictures will were simply Stunning. While some were like okay, few were not so good.<br><br>

          The Camera app has many nice features which I like the Smartscene, Clearimage, HDR.<br><br>

          <b>INDOOR</b><br><br>

          The photos turned out to be above average. In daylight the photos were clear but slightly dull. In Low light the photos had some noise in them. Zooming reduces the quality. All of them are usual things which happens with most smartphones. Overall it was a good experience.<br><br>

          <b>OUTDOOR</b><br><br>

          The outdoor photos were pretty good actually, I liked it. Colours were most of the time accurate and sharpness was there in the images I clicked. It is a nice outdoor photo shooter.<br><br>

          <b>VIDEO</b><br><br>

          It has capabilities to catch 4K video thanks to its hardware. Also it has slo-mo video. The videos recorded nicely and I‚Äôm satisfied with its quality.<br><br>

          <b>BATTERY & UI</b><br><br>

          The ONE comes with 3100 mah battery. Battery life OPO is fairly above average. I can easily get 24 hours of battery life. Flashing new ROMs did reduce more battery but that‚Äôs obvious. Cyanogenmod 11S has no battery saver but I‚Äôve flashed CM12 nightly which has a battery saver (I hardly use it though).<br><br>

          OPO comes with a custom ROM directly flashed by company. That‚Äôs nice. One amazing thing OPO is that the user doesn‚Äôt lose the phone‚Äôs warranty on rooting and flashing which is a blessing for users like me. Global OPO users will get CM12s ota update however indian users won‚Äôt get as Micromax has got exclusive rights of Cyanogenmod in INDIA, hey but don‚Äôt worry remember I said earlier rooting your phone won‚Äôt void your warranty. Infact , OnePlus will be launching their own UI ‚ÄòOxygen OS‚Äô next month. So that‚Äôs something to keep an eye for. Oxygen OS won‚Äôt be an ota , you will have to flash if you intend to use it. Rest the cm11s is near perfect. It is near to stock, elegant, functional and gets the work done flawlessly.<br><br>

          UI and battery are not a problem in this phone.(atleast for me)<br><br>

          <b>CONCLUSION</b><br><br>

          The Invite system is slow but I assure you , you won‚Äôt regret buying this phone. This phone has everything you want at an awesome price, It even beats the awesome Nexus 5 in this segment! No support for SD card might let users down (but seriously? 64 GB ain‚Äôt enough? Some may have different opinion and I respect that). Customer Service is not top notch here as the comoany is very young.<br><br>

          Xiaomi MI4 is its direct rival but I prefer this phone over it simply coz of its UI and awesome developer support at XDA.<br><br>
